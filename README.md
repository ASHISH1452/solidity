We start with the SPDX License Identifier, which specifies the license for the contract.

The pragma solidity ^0.8.0; statement specifies the version of Solidity being used.

The MyToken contract is defined to represent our token.

We declare three state variables:

name: A string variable to store the name of the token.
symbol: A string variable to store the symbol of the token.
totalSupply: An unsigned integer variable to store the total supply of the token.
We define a mapping named balanceOf to keep track of the balance of each address.

An event named Transfer is declared, which will be emitted whenever a transfer occurs.

The constructor is defined to initialize the token. It takes three parameters: _name, _symbol, and _totalSupply. It sets the name, symbol, and totalSupply variables and assigns the total supply to the contract deployer's balance.

The transfer function is defined to allow users to transfer tokens. It takes two parameters: _to (the address to transfer to) and _value (the amount of tokens to transfer). It first checks if the sender has a sufficient balance, then performs the transfer by updating the balances of the sender and receiver. Finally, it emits the Transfer event.
